### Challenges we ran into
- Adapting the outfit recommendations to accommodate diverse cultural and regional preferences like occasion, age, body_type, fit, size and regional nuances - Solved by incorporating [Rent-the-runway dataset](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets.html#clothing_fit).
- Developing a conversational model that understands user data and accordingly generates outfit suggestions - Used [free and open-source Falcon 7B LLM](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/WizardLM-Uncensored-Falcon-7B-GPTQ), unlike conventional APIs that often come with costs.
- GPU limitations - Tackled by setting up an ngrok server on Kaggle's cloud notebook, leveraging GPU-P100 for seamless and resource-efficient model training.
